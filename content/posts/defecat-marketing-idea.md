**Women**: Are you having a hard time getting your man to remember to pick up cat litter at the store?

We get it—he can remember the stats from last night's game, the exact way to grill the perfect steak, and every lyric to a song he hasn't heard since college. But **cat litter**? That's a **whole different ballgame**.

I mean, there are so many brands claiming to be fresh to the step, easy on the scoop, and great at covering up… well, you know.

But let's be real—convincing him to toss a box in the cart without a dramatic sigh? **Nearly impossible**.

**Now**, there's an answer to bury this problem once and for all: **DefeCat**.

Built for men, used by cats.

**DefeCat** isn't just another litter—it's a **badge of honor**. It's the litter that says, "**I handled the job. No complaints. No nagging. No forgetting.**"

It's the ultimate peace treaty in the battle of the shopping list.

And best of all? Your man will be **clawing** at the opportunity to pick one up.
