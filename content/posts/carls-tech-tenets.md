I believe in building technology where it can make a real difference in our daily lives: where the rubber meets the road for our everyday experiences. Here are some of my thoughts that would make a difference in my life:

## 1. Self-Driving Cars

Imagine finishing a hike and having your car pick you up at the trail's endâ€”no need to double back. Or getting dropped off at a concert, with your car self-parking and picking you up later.

## 2. Drones

How about a drone that launches from your car to give you a bird's-eye view when backing up? Or one that can be deployed you on a trail, ready to deliver water, food, or first aid without having to carry everything with you.

## 3. Dashboard Mounted Waze Buttons

A control panel in your car (or on your motorcycle) to alert you of dangers ahead, with easy buttons to report issues or give a thumbs-up. Simple, yet effective. I would purchase a subscription to have these features.

## 4. Hands-Free Horn

Back in the 60's and 70's cars had a foot switch for the high beams. Let's bring that back for the horn. It keeps your hands on the wheel and could save your wrists from airbags if you are in an accident. Here is my first [foot horn prototype](https://github.com/carledwards/foot-horn) in my truck.

## 5. Voice-Activated Horn

On a motorcycle, yelling "Horn!" to activate it would let you keep your hands on the grips, allowing the rider to actively maneuver.

## 6. Satellite GPS on iPhone

Why carry a separate Garmin Zumo XT when your iPhone can do it all? A seamless GPS experience on my motorcycle would be a game-changer.

## 7. The Real Unlock of xAI/Grok: Understanding (My Wife's) Universe

Elon talks about using xAI and Grok to understand the universe. But what if it could understand my wife? Imagine a up-to-date status that tells me her mood to ask about about going for a long motorcycle ride or buying something.
